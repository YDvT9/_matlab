# Simulation-of-Underactuated-AUV-Control-Algorithms
MatLAB and Simulink simulation of different analytical methods of trajectory tracking and path following algorithms for Underactuated Autonomous Vehicles.

Mathematical groundwork for algorithms used in these simulations are based on following research articles:

- [Horizontal trajectory tracking control for an underactuated AUV adopted global integral sliding mode control (Yunbiao Jiang; Chen Guo; Haomiao Yu)](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8408142)

- [Trajectory Tracking and Path Following for Underactuated Marine Vehicles (Claudio Paliotta; Erjen Lefeber; Kristin Ytterstad Pettersen; Jos√© Pinto; Maria Costa)](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8367854)

# Running the simulations
To run the simulations simply clone repository onto your local machine. Open MatLAB, navigate to the directory and open Simulnk's .slx file. After simulation has loaded run the simulation. All the resulting time series will be imported to MatLAB's workspace after the simulation has ended.
